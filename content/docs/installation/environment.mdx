# Environment Variables

These are the environment variables you need to set at your Vercord instance in
Vercel for it to work

<TypeTable
  type={{
    WEBHOOK_INTEGRATION_SECRET: {
      description: 'The secret for the Vercel webhook integration',
      type: 'string',
      default: 'your-secret',
      required: true
    },
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL: {
      description: 'The URL for the Discord webhook integration',
      type: 'string',
      default: 'https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<id>/<token>',
      required: true
    },
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK_USERNAME: {
      description: 'The username for the Discord webhook',
      type: 'string',
      default: 'Vercord',
      required: false
    },
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK_AVATAR_URL: {
      description: 'The avatar URL for the Discord webhook',
      type: 'string',
      default: 'https://vercord.dev/logo.png',
      required: false
    }
  }}
/>

## Security Considerations

- Store your webhook secret securely with a unique value for each integration
- All incoming webhooks are validated using HMAC-SHA1 signatures
- Webhook payloads are validated against a strict schema to ensure data
  integrity

Then just redeploy your Vercord instance and you're done!
